## Introduction
This is a Dockerfile to build a container image for nginx and php-fpm, with the ability to pull website code from git. The container also has the ability to update templated files with variables passed to docker in order to update your settings. There is also support for lets encrypt SSL support.

### Git repository
The source files for this project can be found here: [https://github.com/ngineered/nginx-php-fpm](https://github.com/ngineered/nginx-php-fpm)

If you have any improvements please submit a pull request.
### Docker hub repository
The Docker hub build can be found here: [https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/richarvey/nginx-php-fpm/](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/richarvey/nginx-php-fpm/)
## Versions
| Tag | Nginx | PHP | Alpine |
|-----|-------|-----|--------|
| latest | 1.10.1 | 5.6.23 | 3.4 |
| php5 | 1.10.1 | 5.6.23 | 3.4 |
| php7 | 1.10.1 | 7.0.8 | 3.4 |

## Building from source
To build from source you need to clone the git repo and run docker build:
```
git clone https://github.com/ngineered/nginx-php-fpm.git
docker build -t nginx-php-fpm:latest .
```

## Pulling from Docker Hub
Pull the image from docker hub rather than downloading the git repo. This prevents you having to build the image on every docker host:
```
docker pull richarvey/nginx-php-fpm:latest
```

## Running
To simply run the container:
```
sudo docker run -d richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```

You can then browse to ```http://<DOCKER_HOST>:8080``` to view the default install files. To find your ```DOCKER_HOST``` use the ```docker inspect``` to get the IP address.
### Available Configuration Parameters

The following flags are a list of all the currently supported options that can be changed by passing in the variables to docker with the -e flag.

 - **GIT_REPO** : URL to the repository containing your source code
 - **GIT_BRANCH** : Select a specific branch (optional)
 - **GIT_EMAIL** : Set your email for code pushing (required for git to work)
 - **GIT_NAME** : Set your name for code pushing (required for git to work)
 - **SSH_KEY** : Private SSH deploy key for your repository base64 encoded (requires write permissions for pushing)
 - **WEBROOT** : Change the default webroot directory from `/var/www/html` to your own setting
 - **INDEX_FILES** : Change the default index files from `index.php index.html index.htm` to your own setting
 - **ERRORS** : Set to 1 to display PHP Errors in the browser
 - **TEMPLATE_NGINX_HTML** : Enable by setting to 1 search and replace templating to happen on your code
 - **HIDE_NGINX_HEADERS** : Disable by setting to 0, default behaviour is to hide nginx + php version in headers
 - **PHP_MEM_LIMIT** : Set higher PHP memory limit, default is 128 Mb
 - **PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE** : Set a larger post_max_size, default is 100 Mb
 - **PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE** : Set a larger upload_max_filesize, default is 100 Mb
 - **DOMAIN** : Set domain name for Lets Encrypt scripts

### Dynamically Pulling code from git
One of the nice features of this container is its ability to pull code from a git repository with a couple of environmental variables passed at run time.

**Note:** You need to have your SSH key that you use with git to enable the deployment. I recommend using a special deploy key per project to minimise the risk.

### Preparing your SSH key
The container expects you pass it the __SSH_KEY__ variable with a **base64** encoded private key. First generate your key and then make sure to add it to github and give it write permissions if you want to be able to push code back out the container. Then run:
```
base64 -w 0 /path_to_your_key
```
**Note:** Copy the output be careful not to copy your prompt

To run the container and pull code simply specify the GIT_REPO URL including *git@* and then make sure you have also supplied your base64 version of your ssh deploy key:
```
sudo docker run -d -e 'GIT_REPO=git@git.ngd.io:ngineered/ngineered-website.git' -e 'SSH_KEY=BIG_LONG_BASE64_STRING_GOES_IN_HERE' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```
To pull a repository and specify a branch add the GIT_BRANCH environment variable:
```
sudo docker run -d -e 'GIT_REPO=git@git.ngd.io:ngineered/ngineered-website.git' -e 'GIT_BRANCH=stage' -e 'SSH_KEY=BIG_LONG_BASE64_STRING_GOES_IN_HERE' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```
### Enabling SSL or Special Nginx Configs
You can either map a local folder containing your configs  to /etc/nginx or we recommend editing the files within __conf__ directory that are in the git repo, and then rebuilding the base image.

### Lets Encrypt support (Experimental)
#### Setup
You can use Lets Encrypt to secure your container. Make sure you start the container ```DOMAIN, GIT_EMAIL``` and ```WEBROOT``` variables to enable this to work. Then run:
```
sudo docker exec -t <CONTAINER_NAME> /usr/bin/letsencrypt-setup
```
Ensure your container is accessible on the ```DOMAIN``` you supply in order for this to work
#### Renewal
Lets Encrypt certs expire every 90 days, to renew simply run:
```
sudo docker exec -t <CONTAINER_NAME> /usr/bin/letsencrypt-renew
```
## Special Git Features
You'll need some extra ENV vars to enable this feature. These are ```GIT_EMAIL``` and ```GIT_NAME```. This allows git to be set up correctly and allow the following commands to work.
### Push code to Git
To push code changes made within the container back to git simply run:
```
sudo docker exec -t -i <CONTAINER_NAME> /usr/bin/push
```
### Pull code from Git (Refresh)
In order to refresh the code in a container and pull newer code form git simply run:
```
sudo docker exec -t -i <CONTAINER_NAME> /usr/bin/pull
```
### Templating
**NOTE: You now need to enable templates see below**
This container will automatically configure your web application if you template your code.
### Using environment variables
For example if you are using a MySQL server, and you have a config.php file where you need to set the MySQL details include $$_MYSQL_HOST_$$ style template tags.

Example config.php::
```
<?php
database_host = $$_MYSQL_HOST_$$;
database_user = $$_MYSQL_USER_$$;
database_pass = $$_MYSQL_PASS_$$
...
?>
```

To set the variables simply pass them in as environmental variables on the docker command line.

Example:
```
sudo docker run -d -e 'GIT_REPO=git@git.ngd.io:ngineered/ngineered-website.git' -e 'SSH_KEY=base64_key' -e 'TEMPLATE_NGINX_HTML=1' -e 'GIT_BRANCH=stage' -e 'MYSQL_HOST=host.x.y.z' -e 'MYSQL_USER=username' -e 'MYSQL_PASS=supper_secure_password' richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
```

This will expose the following variables that can be used to template your code.
```
MYSQL_HOST=host.x.y.z
MYSQL_USER=username
MYSQL_PASS=password
```
### Template anything
Yes ***ANYTHING***, any variable exposed by the **-e** flag lets you template your configuration files. This means you can add redis, mariaDB, memcache or anything you want to your application very easily.
## Logging and Errors
### Logging
All logs should now print out in stdout/stderr and are available via the docker logs command:
```
docker logs <CONTAINER_NAME>
```
